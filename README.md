I'm never really sure on what to do with it. I've already developed it dinamically with [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Symphony](https://symfony.com/) (😍) and [Statie](https://www.statie.org/). It used to be a [Wordpress](wordpress.org) blog too. And lately I was thinking on developing it again but on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

But you know what? I don't really blog. There are hundreds of people out there that write better and with so much more to say. When I have anything to add, I'll update my [dev.to blog](https://dev.to/cleiver), I don't want to have just another blog with the same posts that everybody is writing.

So, I'm gonna **K**eep **I**t **S**imple **S**tupid and go back to a time when we relied on pure HTML and CSS. 😄
